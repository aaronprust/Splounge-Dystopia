In the early 2000s, mewonkind's folly led to the breakdown of society and the restructuring of general cultural and technological vector-goals. At some point interest-tribes formed into coherent anarcho-syndicates, creating new economic models which began to isolate themselves in order to maximize survival attributes and minimize unknown variable influences. It was around that time the blast doors went down. Nobody's sure how long exactly; it's been hundreds of season renewals and a ton of spin-offs and crossovers since then though. At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets. Who the hell knows for real though, right?

Whatevs. Feels like just another day in the MASSIVE HIVE KNOWN as CONvergence.

BTW, you sure have made quite the number of enemies.

Today's magic number is 882.

Splounge-Dystopia
An Interactive Fiction by Aaron Prust

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around. You can go north to exit the Space Lounge.

You can see a bar (on which is a glittery box (closed)), many chairs, a black rod and a bartender here.

Overlooking Hallway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod and a floating dolphin (empty) here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a comfy looking chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) and west from here.

This is a ninja outfit, it's black and has a hood that covers your face. It has a nice pocket in it to store cool ninja gear. It has these sweet built in booties that muffle your footsteps as if you were a total ninja, which you totally are if you are wearing this outfit. You could sneak around a place with shadows without being detected if you were wearing this thing. You'd be so ninja.

The black ninja outfit's pocket contains a throwing star and a smoke bomb.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a comfy looking chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) and west from here.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (in which is a security readout)), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) and west from here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see a dolphin code and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

Veranda Walkway (in the floating dolphin)
The floating dolphin is transparent, but tints everything outside very faintly lavender.

Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock here.

You can go north to the Floor Changer, northeast to the Upper Northside Hallway, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up to the Floating Courtyard, and down from here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Space Lounge (in the floating dolphin)
The floating dolphin is transparent, but tints everything outside very faintly lavender.

You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (in which is a security readout)), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway and west from here.

(From here, you can move to east and west.)

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program just chock full of useless information. We have only one rule; please don't cheat - no looking stuff up using centralized data stores. Asking people around you is okay though I suppose. Questions will be simple this round being worth five points a piece, but will increase in both difficulty and value as the game goes on.

This first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

You can go northwest to the Upper Southside Hallway from here.

(From here, you can move to northwest.)

Don't you remember the last time you were in that comfy looking chair? It almost ATE YOU! What is your deal? Don't sit in this comfy looking chair, it's too dangerous! Only a master of mental projection could sit on this comfy looking chair without its super soft comfy-ness obliterating and subsuming your soul to its dark comfy desires.

In the early 2000s, mewonkind's folly led to the breakdown of society and the restructuring of general cultural and technological vector-goals. At some point interest-tribes formed into coherent anarcho-syndicates, creating new economic models which began to isolate themselves in order to maximize survival attributes and minimize unknown variable influences. It was around that time the blast doors went down. Nobody's sure how long exactly; it's been hundreds of season renewals and a ton of spin-offs and crossovers since then though. At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets. Who the hell knows for real though, right?

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a comfy looking chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which is a glittery box (in which are a securityReadout and a bowl (in which is a note))), a bench, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see a dolphin code and a book here.

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast to the Upper Southside Hallway, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down to Under the Veranda Walkway from here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see a dolphin code and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway from here.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (empty) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

The weird ray somehow seems to bend around the bartender and disperses into a cloud of neon-swirled rainbow shards. She looks at you with a strange smirky side-eye. She must be wearing some kind of personal ray-deflector device. "splick", you admire-think.

You can see an airlock here.

In the early 2000"s, mewonkind's folly led to the breakdown of society and the restructuring of general cultural and technological vector-goals. At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets back in school. Now though, you find yourself inside of the massive hive known as CONvergence.

N is one.

Today's magic number is boring.

X is eleven!

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

In the early 2000"s, mewonkind's folly led to the breakdown of society and the restructuring of general cultural and technological vector-goals. At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets back in school. Now though, you find yourself inside of the massive hive known as CONvergence.

N is more than the number of your toes.

Six is the magic number!

X is eleven!

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

The weird ray somehow seems to bend around the bartender and disperses into a cloud of neon-swirled rainbow shards. She looks at you with a strange smirky side-eye. She must be wearing some kind of personal ray-deflector device. "splick", you admire-think.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame, a dolphin code, and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "yzxxy" as Wizex-zi. You are glad there is some way out of that Secret Room!

You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame here.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Floating Courtyard (in the floating dolphin)
The floating dolphin is transparent, but tints everything outside very faintly lavender.

This is amazing - you are up above everything and can see so much up here! There's a pool down below, and a fenced in courtyard with some kind of security gate system surrounding it, and Consuite.

You can go down to the Veranda Walkway from here.

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program super full of useless information. You will be rewarded with an object based on your score at the end of the quiz.

Wrong answers will not be rewarded with correct answers - I'm not telling you the right answer.

I have ONE singular accepted ABSOLUTELY CORRECT answer it's in a table and it is EXACT and PERFECT - I am the ULTIMATE IMPARTIAL QUIZ JUDGE. If you don't like it...cry me a spriver! OH also you are trapped within my quizzy embrace until the end so just accept your fate. Srsly don't try to leave or anything you'll just waste your answer-chances. The quiz is only four rounds of four questions each - just relax you're not stuck in a Quiz Vortex or anything...(I hope...)

Questions in the first round are worth 5 points a piece, but will increase in value as the game goes on.

Answers must be given with Capitalization and exact spelling.

-----------

The first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

This film has annoying gothy villians but a super cool reveal that everyone was in a giant space habitat the WHOLE TIME?! (btw foreshadowing...)

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Overlooking Hallway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see a floating dolphin (empty) here.

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounce this as Xhi-zee.

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around. You can go north to exit the Space Lounge.

You can see a bar (on which is a glittery box (in which are a bowl (in which is a note) and a crazy looking gun)), a soft chair, a skate ramp technology chair, Many soft chairs and a bartender here.

Overlooking Hallway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see a floating dolphin (empty) here.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame, a dolphin code, and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a comfy looking chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

You sit down and are so comfortable - you could really get used to being in this chair. Really! Wowsers...it's just the comfiest thing you probably ever plopped yer can on...it's like you're almost part of this thing...like your skin is melding with it and your insides are turning to some sort of tiny little beans...or a kind of foam batting material...

"What a lovely soft and dreamy world", you think. Nothing is wrong and everything is right. Right and soft. Sooooo sooooofffft.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

You'd rather be asleep. Whatever other thing you would do besides being in this chair is a bad idea and not really that good of an option compared to being in this insanely comfy chair.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

Don't you remember the last time you were in that comfy looking chair? It almost ATE YOU! What is your deal? Don't sit in this comfy looking chair, it's too dangerous!

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) and west from here.

(From here, you can move to east and west.)

Overlooking Hallway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod and a floating dolphin (empty) here.

Don't you remember the last time you were in that softChair? It almost ATE YOU! What is your deal? Don't sit in this softChair, it's too dangerous! Only a master of mental projection could sit on this softChair without its super soft comfy-ness obliterating and subsuming your soul to its dark comfy desires.

You sit down and are so comfortable - you could really get used to being in this chair. Really!

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program super full of useless information. You will be rewarded with an object based on your score at the end of the quiz.

Wrong answers will not be rewarded with correct answers - I'm not telling you the right answer.

I have ONE singular accepted ABSOLUTELY CORRECT answer it's in a table and it is EXACT and PERFECT - I am the ULTIMATE IMPARTIAL QUIZ JUDGE. If you don't like it...cry me a spriver! OH also you are trapped within my quizzy embrace until the end so just accept your fate. Srsly don't try to leave or anything you'll just waste your answer-chances. The quiz is only four rounds of four questions each - just relax you're not stuck in a Quiz Vortex or anything...(I hope...)

Questions in the first round are worth 5 points a piece, but will increase in value as the game goes on.

Answers must be given with Capitalization and exact spelling.

You can go northwest to the Upper Southside Hallway from here.

(From here, you can move to northwest.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. There's a floating platform above the pool.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program super full of useless information. We have only one rule; please don't cheat - which means no looking stuff up using centralized data stores. Asking people around you is okay though I suppose.

Questions will be simple this round being worth five points a piece, but will increase in value as the game goes on.

Answers must be given with Capitalization and exact spelling.

Wrong answers will not be rewarded with correct answers - I'm not telling you the right answer. I have ONE singular accepted ABSOLUTELY CORRECT answer it's in a table and it is EXACT and PERFECT - I am the ULTIMATE IMPARTIAL QUIZ JUDGE. If you don't like it...cry me a spriver! OH also you are trapped within my quizzy embrace until the end so just accept your fate. Srsly don't try to leave or anything you'll just waste your answer-chances. The quiz is only four rounds of four questions each - just relax you're not stuck in a Quiz Vortex or anything...(I hope...)

-----------

The first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

You can go northwest to the Upper Southside Hallway from here.

(From here, you can move to northwest.)

This movie has a sail boat smash into the end of a fake world. Everyone watching just goes totally nuts.

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) and west from here.

(From here, you can move to east and west.)

"How do you know aobut xx?", he says - well it doesn't matter now - just remember yy when you get to the zz okay? DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE YY! Then he looks around again and slowly fades from view, like all the color faded to grey, then all the outlines of his features just slowly alpha-fade to zero.

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a comfy looking chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

In the early 2000s, mewonkind's folly led to the breakdown of society and the restructuring of general cultural and technological vector-goals. At some point interest-tribes formed into coherent anarcho-syndicates, creating new economic models which began to isolate themselves in order to maximize survival attributes and minimize unknown variable influences. It was around that time the blast doors went down. Nobody's sure how long exactly; it's been hundreds of season renewals and a ton of spin-offs and crossovers since then though. At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets. Who the hell knows for real though, right?

Whatevs. Feels like just another day in the MASSIVE HIVE KNOWN as CONvergence.

BTW, you sure have made quite the number of enemies.

It was around that time the blast doors went down. Nobody's sure how long exactly; it's been hundreds of season renewals and a ton of spin-offs and crossovers since then though. At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets. Who the hell knows for real though, right?

Whatevs. Feels like just another day in the MASSIVE HIVE KNOWN as CONvergence.

You have two enemies.

Today's magic number is 597.

The weird ray somehow seems to bend around the bartender and disperses into a cloud of neon-swirled rainbow shards. She looks at you with a strange smirky side-eye. She must be wearing some kind of personal ray-deflector device. "splick", you admire-think.

You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which is a glittery box (in which is a bowl (empty))), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

Sweet it seems like your DiscoWig shielded you from detection. 

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. There's a floating platform above the pool.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program super full of useless information. You will be rewarded with an object based on your score at the end of the quiz.

Wrong answers will not be rewarded with correct answers - I'm not telling you the right answer.

I have ONE singular accepted ABSOLUTELY CORRECT answer it's in a table and it is EXACT and PERFECT - I am the ULTIMATE IMPARTIAL QUIZ JUDGE. If you don't like it...cry me a spriver! OH also you are trapped within my quizzy embrace until the end so just accept your fate. Srsly don't try to leave or anything you'll just waste your answer-chances. The quiz is only four rounds of four questions each - just relax you're not stuck in a Quiz Vortex or anything...(I hope...)

Questions in the first round are worth 5 points a piece, but will increase in value as the game goes on.

Answers must be given with Capitalization and exact spelling.

-----------

The first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

This movie has a sail boat smash into the end of a fake world. Everyone watching just goes totally nuts.

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program super full of useless information. You will be rewarded with an object based on your score at the end of the quiz.

Wrong answers will not be rewarded with correct answers - I'm not telling you the right answer.

I have ONE singular accepted ABSOLUTELY CORRECT answer it's in a table and it is EXACT and PERFECT - I am the ULTIMATE IMPARTIAL QUIZ JUDGE. If you don't like it...cry me a spriver! OH also you are trapped within my quizzy embrace until the end so just accept your fate. Srsly don't try to leave or anything you'll just waste your answer-chances. The quiz is only four rounds of four questions each - just relax you're not stuck in a Quiz Vortex or anything...(I hope...)

Questions in the first round are worth 5 points a piece, but will increase in value as the game goes on.

Answers must be given with Capitalization and exact spelling.

The first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

In which film did someone get offered a choice between two pills and then didn't take both of them like they should have?

Round4
This is it, the final round. You're so close to escaping this quiz that not even a Quiz Vortex could keep you from exiting the quiz-field. The questions are worth twenty points a piece.

This round is about choices, random forces and what they lead to...which is of course PARALLEL UNIVERSES!

Every imagined-not-taken choice spawned from every individual's mind throughout time and space creating entire universes with every passing thought. The vast sea of thought embracing the infinite seeds of thought; the birth of what-ifs reflecting infinitely. 

Who wrote The Coming of the Quantum Cats, which includes a parallel universe prison planet, and a triad -relationship including three different versions of the same person? (OMG that is so hawt!)

This is it, the final round. You're so close to escaping this quiz that not even a Quiz Vortex could keep you from exiting the quiz-field. The questions are worth twenty points a piece.

This round is about choices, random forces and what they lead to...which is of course PARALLEL UNIVERSES!

Every imagined-not-taken choice spawned from every individual's mind throughout time and space creating entire universes with every passing thought. The vast sea of thought embracing the infinite seeds of thought; the birth of what-ifs reflecting infinitely.

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program super full of useless information. You will be rewarded with an object based on your score at the end of the quiz.

Wrong answers will not be rewarded with correct answers - I'm not telling you the right answer.

I have ONE singular accepted ABSOLUTELY CORRECT answer it's in a table and it is EXACT and PERFECT - I am the ULTIMATE IMPARTIAL QUIZ JUDGE. If you don't like it...cry me a spriver! OH also you are trapped within my quizzy embrace until the end so just accept your fate. Srsly don't try to leave or anything you'll just waste your answer-chances. The quiz is only four rounds of four questions each - just relax you're not stuck in a Quiz Vortex or anything...(I hope...)

Questions in the first round are worth 5 points a piece, but will increase in value as the game goes on.

Answers must be given with Capitalization and exact spelling.

-----------

The first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

You can go northwest to the Upper Southside Hallway from here.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a comfy looking chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

Sweet, it seems like your DiscoWig shielded you from detection. 

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. There's a floating platform above the pool.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

In the early 2000s, mewonkind's folly led to the breakdown of society and the restructuring of general cultural and technological vector-goals. At some point interest-tribes formed into coherent anarcho-syndicates, creating new economic models which began to isolate themselves in order to maximize survival attributes and minimize unknown variable influences. It was around that time the blast doors went down. Nobody's sure how long exactly; it's been hundreds of season renewals and a ton of spin-offs and crossovers since then though. At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets. Who the hell knows for real though, right?

Whatevs. Feels like just another day in the MASSIVE HIVE KNOWN as CONvergence.

BTW, you sure have made quite the number of enemies.

Floating Courtyard
This is amazing - you are up above everything and can see so much up here! There's a pool down below, and a fenced in courtyard with some kind of security gate system surrounding it, and Consuite.

You can go down from here.

(From here, you can move to down.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (in which are a security readout and a bowl (in which is a note)) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway from here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame, a dolphin code, and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a comfy looking chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) and west from here.

"Hey Wait!" your subconscious jumps forth remembering the tempting softness - you decide not not to sit on that comfy looking chair, it's so comfy you might never get up again! It looks seriously comfy though...maybe just for a little tiny sliver of a moment you could get kinda comfy...

Don't you remember the last time you were in that comfy looking chair? It almost ATE YOU! What is your deal? Don't sit in this comfy looking chair, it's too dangerous! Only a master of mental projection could sit on this comfy looking chair without its super soft comfy-ness obliterating and subsuming your soul to its dark comfy desires.

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program super full of useless information. We have only one rule; please don't cheat - which means no looking stuff up using centralized data stores. Asking people around you is okay though I suppose.

Questions will be simple this round being worth five points a piece, but will increase in value as the game goes on.

Answers must be given with Capitalization and exact spelling.

Wrong answers will not be rewarded with correct answers - I'm not telling you the right answer. I have ONE singular accepted ABSOLUTELY CORRECT answer it's in a table and it is EXACT and PERFECT - I am the ULTIMATE IMPARTIAL QUIZ JUDGE. If you don't like it...cry me a spriver! OH also you are trapped within my quizzy embrace until the end so just accept your fate. Srsly don't try to leave or anything you'll just waste your answer-chances. The quiz is only four rounds of four questions each - just relax you're not stuck in a Quiz Vortex or anything...(I hope...)

-----------

The first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

You can go northwest to the Upper Southside Hallway from here.

(From here, you can move to northwest.)

Round4
This is it, the final round. You're so close to escaping this quiz that not even a Quiz Vortex could keep you from exiting the quiz-field. The questions are worth twenty points a piece.

This round is about choices, random forces and what they lead to...which is of course PARALLEL UNIVERSES!

Every imagined-not-taken choice spawned from every individual's mind throughout time and space creating entire universes with every passing thought. The vast sea of thought embracing the infinite seeds of thought; the birth of what-ifs reflecting infinitely. 

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

What movie about parallel universes involves a good version of Jet Li trying to stop an evil version of Jet Li who is determined to gain ultimate power by being the only version of himself throughout all universes?

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a comfy looking chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) and west from here.

This weird ray comes out of your gun but it's like it's moving in slow-motion...as the beam wiggles toward Aframe super duper slow he steps out of the way of it. The wiggling intensifies and disappears. Aframe is looking at you with this annoyed look. Like he doesn't totally trust you anymore because you just tried to twinkle him out of existence.

A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

As you enter the Veranda Walkway you see a floating dolphin surveillance pod.
Sweet, it seems like your AdBlaster2000 shielded you from detection. 

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. There's a floating platform above the pool.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program super full of useless information. You will be rewarded with an object based on your score at the end of the quiz.

Wrong answers will not be rewarded with correct answers - I'm not telling you the right answer.

I have ONE singular accepted ABSOLUTELY CORRECT answer it's in a table and it is EXACT and PERFECT - I am the ULTIMATE IMPARTIAL QUIZ JUDGE. If you don't like it...cry me a spriver! OH also you are trapped within my quizzy embrace until the end so just accept your fate. Srsly don't try to leave or anything you'll just waste your answer-chances. The quiz is only four rounds of four questions each - just relax you're not stuck in a Quiz Vortex or anything...(I hope...)

Questions in the first round are worth 5 points a piece, but will increase in value as the game goes on.

Answers must be given with Capitalization and exact spelling.

-----------

The first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

You can go northwest to the Upper Southside Hallway from here.

Round4
This is it, the final round. You're so close to escaping this quiz that not even a Quiz Vortex could keep you from exiting the quiz-field. The questions are worth twenty points a piece.

This round is about choices, random forces and what they lead to...which is of course PARALLEL UNIVERSES!

Every imagined-not-taken choice spawned from every individual's mind throughout time and space creating entire universes with every passing thought. The vast sea of thought embracing the infinite seeds of thought; the birth of what-ifs reflecting infinitely.

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a comfy looking chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) and west from here.

You can see an airlock, a chair, and a bartender here.

[looking - succeeded]

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a comfy looking chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) and west from here.

"Hey Wait!" your subconscious jumps forth remembering the tempting softness - you decide not not to sit on that chair, it's so comfy you might never get up again! It looks seriously comfy though...maybe just for a little tiny sliver of a moment you could get kinda comfy...

Don't you remember the last time you were in that chair? It almost ATE YOU! What is your deal? Don't sit in this chair, it's too dangerous! Only a master of mental projection could sit on this chair without its super soft comfy-ness obliterating and subsuming your soul to its dark comfy desires.

In the early 2000s, mewonkind's folly led to the breakdown of society and the restructuring of general cultural and technological vector-goals. At some point interest-tribes formed into coherent anarcho-syndicates, creating new economic models which began to isolate themselves in order to maximize survival attributes and minimize unknown variable influences. It was around that time the blast doors went down. Nobody's sure how long exactly; it's been hundreds of season renewals and a ton of spin-offs and crossovers since then though. At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets. Who the hell knows for real though, right?

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program just chock full of useless information. We have only one rule; please don't cheat - no looking stuff up using centralized data stores. Asking people around you is okay though I suppose. Questions will be simple this round being worth five points a piece, but will increase in both difficulty and value as the game goes on.

This first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

You can go northwest to the Upper Southside Hallway from here.

Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. There's a floating platform above the pool.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program super full of useless information. We have only one rule; please don't cheat - which means no looking stuff up using centralized data stores. Asking people around you is okay though I suppose.

Questions will be simple this round being worth five points a piece, but will increase in value as the game goes on.

Answers must be given with Capitalization and exact spelling.

Wrong answers will not be rewarded with correct answers - I'm not telling you the right answer. I have ONE singular accepted ABSOLUTELY CORRECT answer it's in a table and it is EXACT and PERFECT - I am the ULTIMATE IMPARTIAL QUIZ JUDGE. If you don't like it...cry me a spriver! OH also you are trapped within my quizzy embrace until the end so just accept your fate. Srsly don't try to leave or anything you'll just waste your answer-chances. The quiz is only four rounds of four questions each - just relax you're not stuck in a Quiz Vortex or anything...(I hope...)

The first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program?

Round4
This is it, the final round. You're so close to escaping this quiz that not even a Quiz Vortex could keep you from exiting the quiz-field. The questions are worth twenty points a piece.

This round is about choices, random forces and what they lead to...which is of course PARALLEL UNIVERSES!

Every imagined-not-taken choice spawned from every individual's mind throughout time and space creating entire universes with every passing thought. The vast sea of thought embracing the infinite seeds of thought; the birth of what-ifs reflecting infinitely.

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program super full of useless information. We have only one rule; please don't cheat - which means no looking stuff up using centralized data stores. Asking people around you is okay though I suppose.

Questions will be simple this round being worth five points a piece, but will increase in value as the game goes on.

Answers must be given with Capitalization and exact spelling.

Wrong answers will not be rewarded with correct answers - I'm not telling you the right answer. I have ONE singular accepted ABSOLUTELY CORRECT answer - I am the ULTIMATE IMPARTIAL QUIZ JUDGE. If ya don't like it..CRY ME A SPRIVER! Once you start the quiz you are trapped within it's quizzy embrace until the end so now is your chance to leave. Go on - git! COWARDS...

This first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

You can go northwest to the Upper Southside Hallway from here.

(From here, you can move to northwest.)

This movie has a sail boat smash into the end of a fake world. Everyone watching just goes totally nuts.

Answers must be given with Capitalization and exact spelling.

Wrong answers will not be rewarded with correct answers - I'm not telling you the right answer. I have ONE singular accepted ABSOLUTELY CORRECT answer it's in a table and it is EXACT and PERFECT - I am the ULTIMATE IMPARTIAL QUIZ JUDGE. If ya don't like it...CRY ME A SPRIVER! OH BTW you are trapped within my quizzy embrace until the end so just accept your fate. Srsly don't try to leave or anything you'll just waste your answer-chances. The quiz is only four rounds of four questions each - just relax you're not stuck in a Quiz Vortex or anything...(I hope...)

Sweet it seems like your AdBlaster2000 shielded you from detection. 

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program super full of useless information. We have only one rule; please don't cheat - no looking stuff up using centralized data stores. Asking people around you is okay though I suppose.

Questions will be simple this round being worth five points a piece, but will increase value as the game goes on.

Answers must be given with Capitalization and exact spelling.

Wrong answers will not be rewarded with correct answers so get it right! If ya don't like it...cry me a spriver! Once you start the quiz you are trapped within it's quizzy embrace until the end so now is your chance to leave.

This first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

You can go northwest to the Upper Southside Hallway from here.

(From here, you can move to northwest.)

This film has annoying gothy villians but a super cool reveal that everyone was in a giant space habitat the WHOLE TIME?! (btw foreshadowing...)

Please enter your answer &gt;</result>

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a comfy looking chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a securityBot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) and west from here.
