In the early 2000s, mewonkind's folly led to the breakdown of society and the restructuring of general cultural and technological vector-goals. At some point interest-tribes formed into coherent anarcho-syndicates, creating new economic models which began to isolate themselves in order to maximize survival attributes and minimize unknown variable influences. It was around that time the blast doors went down. Nobody's sure how long exactly; it's been hundreds of season renewals and a ton of spin-offs and crossovers since then though. At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets. Who the hell knows for real though, right?

Whatevs. Feels like just another day in the MASSIVE HIVE KNOWN as CONvergence.

You have two enemies.

Today's magic number is 139.

Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod and a floating dolphin (empty) here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) and west from here.

(From here, you can move to east and west.)

Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north to the Floor Changer, northeast to the Upper Northside Hallway, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see a dolphin code and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a floating dolphin (empty), a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (in which is a security readout)), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway and west to the BehindtheBar from here.

(From here, you can move to east and west.)

Floating Courtyard
This is amazing - you are up above everything and can see so much up here! There's a pool down below, and a fenced in courtyard with some kind of security gate system surrounding it, and Consuite.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock here.

You can go north to the Floor Changer, northeast to the Upper Northside Hallway, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up to the Floating Courtyard, and down from here.

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program just chock full of useless information. We have only one rule; please don't cheat - no looking stuff up using centralized data stores. Asking people around you is okay though I suppose. Questions will be simple this round being worth five points a piece, but will increase in both difficulty and value as the game goes on.

This first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

You can go northwest to the Upper Southside Hallway from here.

(From here, you can move to northwest.)

Don't you remember the last time you were in that chair? It almost ATE YOU! What is your deal? Don't sit in this chair, it's too dangerous! Only a master of mental projection could sit on this chair without its super soft comfy-ness obliterating and subsuming your soul to its dark desires (whatever they might be).

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast to the Upper Southside Hallway, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down to Under the Veranda Walkway from here.

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard.

Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see a dolphin code and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway from here.

The weird ray somehow seems to bend around the bartender and disperses into a cloud of neon-swirled rainbow shards. She looks at you with a strange smirky side-eye. She must be wearing some kind of personal ray-deflector device. "splick", you admire-think.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

In the early 2000"s, mewonkind's folly led to the breakdown of society and the restructuring of general cultural and technological vector-goals. At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets back in school. Now though, you find yourself inside of the massive hive known as CONvergence.

N is one.

Today's magic number is boring.

X is eleven!

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see a dolphin code and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

In the early 2000"s, mewonkind's folly led to the breakdown of society and the restructuring of general cultural and technological vector-goals. At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets back in school. Now though, you find yourself inside of the massive hive known as CONvergence.

N is more than the number of your toes.

Six is the magic number!

X is eleven!

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

The weird ray somehow seems to bend around the bartender and disperses into a cloud of neon-swirled rainbow shards. She looks at you with a strange smirky side-eye. She must be wearing some kind of personal ray-deflector device. "splick", you admire-think.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame, a dolphin code, and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

When you mention xx, Aframe's eyes light up. He smiles and looks around the room for a second before stepping closer to you. "How do you know aobut xx?", he says - well it doesn't matter now - just remember yy when you get to the zz okay? DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE YY! Then he looks around again and slowly fades from view, like all the color faded to grey, then all the outlines of his features just slowly alpha-fade to zero.

You can see an airlock and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "yzxxy" as Wizex-zi. You are glad there is some way out of that Secret Room!

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Floating Courtyard (in the floating dolphin)
The floating dolphin is transparent, but tints everything outside very faintly lavender.

This is amazing - you are up above everything and can see so much up here! There's a pool down below, and a fenced in courtyard with some kind of security gate system surrounding it, and Consuite.

You can go down to the Veranda Walkway from here.

(From here, you can move to down.)

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Overlooking Hallway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see a floating dolphin (empty) here.

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounce this as Xhi-zee.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame, a dolphin code, and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

This weird ray comes out of your gun but it's like it's moving in slow-motion...as the beam wiggles toward Aframe super duper slow he steps out of the way of it. The wiggling intensifies and disappears. Aframe is looking at you with this annoyed look. Like he doesn't totally trust you anymore because you just tried to twinkle him out of existence.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Overlooking Hallway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod and a floating dolphin (empty) here.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program just chock full of useless information. We have only one rule; please don't cheat - no looking stuff up using centralized data stores. Asking people around you is okay though I suppose. Questions will be simple this round being worth five points a piece, but will increase in both difficulty and value as the game goes on.

This first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

You can go northwest to the Upper Southside Hallway from here.

(From here, you can move to northwest.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

As you enter the Veranda Walkway you see a floating dolphin surveillance pod.
Sweet it seems like your DiscoWig shielded you from detection. 

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

This weird ray comes out of your gun but it's like it's moving in slow-motion...as the beam wiggles toward Aframe super duper slow he steps out of the way of it. The wiggling intensifies and disappears. Aframe is looking at you with this annoyed look. Like he doesn't totally trust you anymore because you just tried to twinkle him out of existence.

You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which is a glittery box (in which are a security readout and a bowl (in which is a note))), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) and west from here.

The weird ray somehow seems to bend around the bartender and disperses into a cloud of neon-swirled rainbow shards. She looks at you with a strange smirky side-eye. She must be wearing some kind of personal ray-deflector device. "splick", you admire-think.

Floating Courtyard
This is amazing - you are up above everything and can see so much up here! There's a pool down below, and a fenced in courtyard with some kind of security gate system surrounding it, and Consuite.

You can go down from here.

(From here, you can move to down.)

This weird ray comes out of your gun but it's like it's moving in slow-motion...as the beam wiggles toward Aframe super duper slow he steps out of the way of it. The wiggling intensifies and disappears. Aframe is looking at you with this annoyed look. Like he doesn't totally trust you anymore because you just tried to twinkle him out of existence.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (in which are a security readout and a bowl (in which is a note)) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, and a Security bot here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame, a dolphin code, and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard.

Round1
Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, a computer program just chock full of useless information. We have only one rule; please don't cheat - no looking stuff up using centralized data stores. Asking people around you is okay though I suppose. Questions will be simple this round being worth five points a piece, but will increase in both difficulty and value as the game goes on.

This first section is on films involving simulated realities and questionable memories.

Who are you? Are you your memories? Are you what you have done? Are you what you will do? Or are you nothing at all but a wisp...or maybe "just" a program? 

You can go northwest to the Upper Southside Hallway from here.

(From here, you can move to northwest.)

Oh Aaaaaaaron eh!? I've heard a you.
Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge. It's dim and glowy all over with pulsating colors and subtle hypnotic sounds.

You can see an airlock, a black ninja outfit, a bar (on which are a Glowing Sphere and a glittery box (closed)), a bench, a chair, a bartender, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

        <result xml:space="preserve">OOOOoooo glowy-sphere thingie! Its purple soft glow makes you feel safe and secure. It looks like there's some sort of helix-key as a component to the glowy-ness but it's unclear how you would remove it.
